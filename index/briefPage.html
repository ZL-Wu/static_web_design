	Brief Introduction of our web Design - Assignmemt3</h1>

	<!-- Content -->
	<h2>Content:</h2>
	<b>This is our web structure: <br><img src="./images/structure.jpg" width="700px"></b>
	<p>The goal of our web is to introduce "Tampa" city to the tourists, and help them know this city quickly. Then we divided it into three dimensions:</p>
	<ur>
		<li><b>Tampa Travel:</b> introduces attractions in Tampa. So far, we completed Busch Garden Theme Park.</li>
		<li><b>Tampa Eat:</b> introduces some good restaurants, such as Columbia Restaurant, Noble Rice, Sa Ri One Grill.</li>
		<li><b>Tampa Sport:</b> introduces the professional ice hockey team in Tampa, Tampa Bay Lightning.</li>
	</ur>
	<p>In every subpage, we tried to explain theme by many topics, such as photos, introduction, videos and so on</p>

	<!-- Usability -->
	<h2>Usability:</h2>
	<img src="./images/navBar1.jpg" width="700px" >
	<img src="./images/navBar2.jpg" width="700px" >
	<p>In order to let Users feel free and easy to browse. We create a uniform and concise navigation bar on interface in every page. Users can easily enter the three subpages from homepage, and easily jump to each topic in the subpage.</p>
	<img src="./images/photoBoard.jpg" width="700px" >
	<p>We put an eye-catching photo board on every page. We believe pictures are more convincing than words. Therefore Users can quickly get an intuitive feeling on each subject</p>

	<!-- Responsiveness -->
	<h2>Responsiveness: </h2>
	<img src="./images/iphone.jpg" height="300px" style="border: 1px solid #aaaaaa; float: left; margin:0 50px;">
	<img src="./images/pc.jpg" height="300px" style="border: 1px solid #aaaaaa; float: left;">
	<div style="clear: both;"></div>
	<p>We want to make pages layout display same on each device. So we didn’t use flex layout to be compatible with any device but controlled the page layout in a uniform style by CSS code: <code>.body{ width:1000px; margin: 0 auto;}</code> <br>Therefore, every page has only 1000px width and display the same at any device.</p>

	<!-- Design -->
	<h2>Design:</h2>
	<p>We designed this website based on these guidelines:</p>
	<ur>
		<li><b>Simple and clean interface: </b>try to minimize the mix of different color types.</li>
		<li><b>Clear and easy page: </b>clear navigation and neat block arrangment.</li>
		<li><b>Pictures and videos: </b>they are more intuitive than words.</li>
	</ur>

	<!-- self reflection -->
	<h2>Shortage</h2>
	<p>This is not a finished product, there are still some shortages: </p>
	<ur>
		<li><b></b>In order to easily manage framework layout, we sacrifaced compatibility layouts on different devices.</li>
		<li><b></b>In the three dimensions, we still have many attractions, foods and sports that are not introduced yet.</li>
		<li><b></b>Due to lack of JS skills, we have many excellent animation effects ideas that cannot be achieved.</li>
	</ur>
